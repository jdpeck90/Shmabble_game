## MVP 
My minimial viable product for this game was having a simple word game web app where users could play against the clock and get points for the words they played. I also wanted a a highscore board that could hold scores with local storage. 

## Improvements Made
* Connected this app to the glosbe online dictionary api to check if the played words are in the dictionary
* Wrote an algorythm to make sure that the letters played are in the same row or column. 
* Wrote an algorythm to connect previously played chips to newly played chips to create new words.
